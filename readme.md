# EMULACRON

> or smth like that idk

This is a folder containing the best possible emulators I could possibly find for well known retro game systems.

Most of these emulators-- if not all of them have *very* high accuracy, but has its own quirks that you could ignore.

## What fucking emulators are included?

Emulators marked with a link should be downloaded separately.

This emulator collection does not include firmware and bios. I may support piracy, but just fucking google it man...

This collection has also no roms of any kind. Google it!
