This folder contains setting overrides for some, more or less random, games (more to come). 
To use those, copy them to the same folder as the ROM and rename them to the same name as the ROM (except for the extension ".bso").
They are commented. So you can open them in a text editor and adapt them to your specific requirements (e.g. remove disabling of widescreen markers if you prefer those).
General information on setting overrides is available in the main readme.
To contribute new or improved setting overrides for this collection join us on our Discord (preferred) or open a GitHub issue:

The Super Metroid widescreen patch subfolder has its own readme.
