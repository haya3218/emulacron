Super Metroid widescreen patch

2021-23-05, by ocesse

This folder contains a patch and a setting overrides file for Super Metroid (US+JP version).
To use those, copy both to the same folder as the ROM and rename them to the same name as the ROM (except for the extensions ".bps" and ".bso").
(Since bsnes-hd 10.5 these instructions apply to the libretro core as well, so RetroArch users no longer have to manually patch the ROM or adjust the settings.)

The patch has been developed by ocesse. If you want to report issues, share ideas or just talk about widescreen patches join us on our Discord:
